/*
topological sort - works on directed acyclic graph (DAG) i.e on directed graphs with no cycles.
topological sorting is used only for DAGs(not for non-DAGs).
it is a linear order of vertices such that every directed edge u --> v, the vertex u comes before v in the order.
its like the node on which another node is depending should come first i.e like dependency.
