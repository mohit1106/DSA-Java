# ğŸ§  Beautiful Array Cheat Sheet

## ğŸ”¹ Problem Summary
Return a permutation of `[1..n]` such that for **every** `i < k < j`:
```
2 * nums[k] != nums[i] + nums[j]
```
I.e., no element is the average of any two others.

## ğŸ”‘ Key Observations
- We need to **avoid arithmetic progressions** of length 3.
- A brute-force way to check all triplets is too slow (O(nÂ³)).
- Greedy and standard backtracking donâ€™t help â€” no local rule gives a global solution.

---

## ğŸ§  Core Insight
You can **construct a beautiful array recursively**:
- Start with `n = 1 â†’ [1]` is trivially beautiful.
- Use divide-and-conquer to build larger arrays.

## ğŸ§± Construction Approach

To build a beautiful array of size `n`:

1. Build a beautiful array of size `(n + 1) / 2`  
   â†’ map it to **odd numbers** using:  
   `2 * x - 1`

2. Build a beautiful array of size `n / 2`  
   â†’ map it to **even numbers** using:  
   `2 * x`

3. Combine the two arrays â†’ this is the beautiful array for `n`.

ğŸ“Œ **Why this works:**
- Odd + even numbers are **far apart** numerically.
- No arithmetic progression can span across them.
- Subarrays are also beautiful, and the mapping preserves that.

## ğŸ§  Mental Model

Think of this as a recursive tree:
```
BA(n) â†’ odd-part from BA((n+1)/2), even-part from BA(n/2)
```

## ğŸ“Œ Final Tip (When to Use This)

Use this pattern when:
- You're asked to return a permutation of `[1..n]` with **no arithmetic progressions / no element as an average of two others**.
- Constraints are large, and brute-force wonâ€™t cut it.
- The problem guarantees a solution exists â€” usually hinting a constructive method is expected.

## ğŸ›  Time and Space Complexity
- **Time:** O(n log n)
- **Space:** O(n) (due to recursion + result array)

## ğŸ’» Java Solution Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] beautifulArray(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return new int[]{1};
        }
        int[] odd = beautifulArray((n + 1) / 2); // build odd part
        int[] even = beautifulArray(n / 2);      // build even part
        
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int index = 0;
        
        // Map odd part to odd numbers: 2*x - 1
        for (int x : odd) {
            result[index++] = 2 * x - 1;
        }
        // Map even part to even numbers: 2*x
        for (int x : even) {
            result[index++] = 2 * x;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## âœ… Example

For `n = 5`, the output might be:
```
[1, 5, 3, 2, 4]
```
Which satisfies the beautiful array condition.
